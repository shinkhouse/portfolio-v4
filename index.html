          <h3>Graceland University</h3>
          <p>During my three years as a Student Technology Assistant, I have assisted in the implementation of Linux based and Android based digital
            signage systems on campus. I have recorded lectures and edited them for professors. I have assisted students with diagnosing computer
            errors and installing software for them. In addition, I go around to classrooms and do repairs on projectors; replacing their cabling,
            making sure they are on the correct settings, and replacing projector light bulbs.</p>

            <h3>Smith & Associates</h3>
            <p>At Smith & Associates, I was blessed with an opportunity to have an internship in Houston! They taught me how to use AngularJS for frontend development. I worked on a module of their customer relationship management system called Partmatch. After finishing AngularJS tutorials, I started to work on a Java back end solution to access information from their databases using RESTful APIs with CRUD principles. A majority of my time was spent creating a front end for the Partmatch module using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the AngularJS framework. It was great experience working with them. </p>

            <h3>Musco Lighting</h3>
            <p>I worked for Musco Lighting for two summers, working on building wire harnesses and running product testing on wire harnesses. I constructed laser housing for the laser relays used to calibrate
              the position of the lights and putting together brackets and plates for power devices. I also assembled surge protection devices and built yokes and cones.</p>

            <p>For my PHP class, I had to make a fast food website that would allow a user to sign up and see the food we offer. I also made a admin portal that allowed the manager
              to add food and ingredients to the menu.</p>
